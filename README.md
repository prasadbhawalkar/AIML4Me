This is a part of my learning journey for AIML4Me.
This script is a simple "matrix to graph" rendering that, while watching this video https://x.com/TivadarDanka/status/2011454039989604420?s=20, I realized I could "generate" so I uses VScode copilot to generate it. 

Nothing belongs to me - neither the code, nor the logic. Learning is fun !
