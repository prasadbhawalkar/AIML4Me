This is a part of my learning journey for AIML4Me.
Some scripts are for experimenting and some are for just amazement ! 

Nothing belongs to me - neither the code, nor the logic. Learning is fun !

1. PrasadMatrixToGraphToHTML.py - This script is a simple "matrix to graph" rendering that, while watching this video https://x.com/TivadarDanka/status/2011454039989604420?s=20, I realized I could "generate" so I used VScode copilot to generate it.
